James Bond is a Secret Intelligence Service agent, code number 007, residing in London but active internationally.
<!--more-->
Bond was a composite character who was based on a number of commandos whom Fleming knew during his service in the Naval Intelligence Division
during the Second World War, to whom Fleming added his own style and a number of his own tastes.

Fleming claimed that Bond's name was appropriated from the American ornithologist of the same name; however, new reports have emerged claiming
Fleming may have got the name from a Welsh agent he served with, one James C. Bond.

Bond has a number of consistent character traits which run throughout the books, including an enjoyment of cars, a love of food,
alcohol, and love-making, and a smoking habit of 60 custom-made cigarettes a day.
